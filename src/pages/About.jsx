                    Hello! I'm <strong>Don</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love learning new things and challenging myself.
                </p>

                    I am passionate about using data to solve complex problems. I am happiest
                    when I have a nice and big source of data to play with. Nothing brings me more 
                    satisfaction than discovering a new and interesting technique to uncover hidden insights
                    from the data. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights, watching anime and cooking.
                    Though I have a crippling fear of heights, I've also somehow managed to hike
                    through some of the world's most dangerous mountains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a double degree in Business and Communications and New Media. 
                    Throughout my 4 years, my GPA for each degree never dropped below 4.5/5.0.
